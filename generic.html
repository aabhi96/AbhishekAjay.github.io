									<h1>Professional Summary</h1>
									<p>An aspiring Analyst and a Bachelors of Science Degree in Information Systems 
										from the University of Texas at Arlington. Additionally, I hold a Google Data 
										Analytics Professional Certificate, demonstrating my commitment to staying 
										current with industry best practices and emerging technologies.
									   Passionate about leveraging data to unlock business potential, I possess expertise
									    in data analysis, process optimization, and problem-solving. Currently seeking 
									   challenging roles in the Healthcare or Financial Sector, I am committed to making 
									   data-driven decisions that drive business growth and efficiency. 
									   </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Professional_photo.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I am a dedicated data analyst with a strong proficiency in analytical tools and 
									programming languages like SQL, R, and Excel. My professional journey has equipped
									 me with comprehensive skills in data collection, cleansing, and visualization, 
									 where I have leveraged advanced tools such as Tableau and Power BI to translate 
									 raw data into actionable insights. My ability to deliver valuable insights through 
									 data-driven analysis and predictive modeling has been a hallmark of my career.</p>

								<p>In addition to my technical skills, I bring a wealth of experience in system analysis 
									methodologies, with a proven track record of enhancing efficiency and reducing costs 
									through effective data mining. My commitment to clear and concise communication, 
									coupled with my collaborative nature, has made me an effective team player in data-centric 
									business environments. Moreover, I am dedicated to continuous learning, recognizing the 
									ever-evolving landscape of data analysis.</p>

								<p>My technical expertise encompasses languages such as Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), 
									R, and SQL, including SQL Server and MySQL. I am proficient in data analysis tools like
									 Microsoft Excel, where I utilize functions such as VLookup, Conditional Formatting, and 
									 Pivot Tables. Additionally, I have experience with project management methodologies like 
									 Agile and Waterfall, and I am well-versed in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, 
									 requirements gathering, and data governance and compliance.</p>
									
								<p>During my tenure as a Data Analyst Intern at Chartwells Group in Arlington, TX, I made 
									significant contributions to the company's success. I implemented customer feedback analysis 
									strategies that boosted customer satisfaction scores by 12% and led to a 7% increase in repeat 
									business. Furthermore, I identified cost-saving opportunities through data analysis, resulting 
									in an annual 12% reduction in expenses and increased profitability. Collaborating with cross-functional 
									teams, I contributed to market data analysis, assisting in the development of pricing strategies aligned 
									with customer preferences and market trends. I also led a team in executing efficiency enhancements, 
									reducing wait times by a remarkable 15%, ultimately enhancing the customer experience.</p>
									
								<p>In my projects, I have demonstrated my ability to clean and enhance data. For example, in the "Nashville 
									Housing Raw Data Cleaning" project, I revamped a housing dataset of 56,000 records using SQL Server, 
									improving data structure and accessibility. I employed SQL queries to address NULL values and eliminate 
									redundant data, resulting in a well-organized dataset ready for in-depth analysis. Similarly, in the 
									"COVID-19 Data Exploration" project, I conducted thorough data preparation and cleaning using SQL queries, 
									standardizing the COVID-19 dataset for consistent and reliable analysis. Leveraging Tableau and SQL, 
									I created interactive visualizations that effectively communicated infection rates across diverse countries, 
									contributing to informed pandemic responses and vaccination strategies.</p>

								<p>Discover my full range of skills and expertise in the "Technical Skills" section below, 
									where I showcase my proficiency in data analysis, programming, problem-solving, and more. 
									Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to the opportunity to work together.</p>
